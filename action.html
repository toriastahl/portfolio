        <div class="tips">
        <h2>Reduce travel/transportation</h2>
        <p>consider carpool, biking, flying less. A little known fact is how much your ecological footprint can be reduced by flying less! (one flight is on average 1/18th of the average Americanâ€™s ecological footprint)</p>

        <h2>Eat less meat</h2>
