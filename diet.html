		<h1>What does a Sustainable Diet Look Like?</h1>
	</header>

	<main>

		<p>My journey - after taking Environ 208 (business & the environment) and studying different companies' impacts on the environments I decided to change my diet to lower my ecological footprint. Ecological footprint is the measure of human impact on Earthâ€™s ecosystem. The meat industry is a huge contributor to CO2 in the atmosphere which causes global warming, so cutting meat out of my diet was a really easy way to reduce my CO2 emissions.</p>

		<p>As a pescatraian I only eat fish. I chose to start as a pescatarian because I wanted to make sure I had enough protein in my diet during this transition. Here are some examples of what I eat on a daily basis!</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Tofu</li>
			<li>Peanut & nut butter</li>
			<li>Eggs</li>
			<li>Chickpeas & hummus</li>
		  </ul>
